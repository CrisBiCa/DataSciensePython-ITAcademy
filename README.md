# DataSciensePython-ITAcademy

This will be the repository where I will add all the exercices proposed in the Sprints I'm doing during the course of Data Science with Python.
This course is done by the ITAcademy from the Barcelona council.

This repository will also be used to share the tasks with the tutor I have from the course
